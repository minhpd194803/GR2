the project was made using vuejs accompanied with a nuxtjs framework. Here, nuxtjs works as a navigator to guide the user through pages. 

This project presents a basic explorer for the chain cosmos, minor changes to this project could make it explore more chains if necessary. The work currently shows the latest blocks, latest transactions and top validators. upon clicking any block or transaction, the page transitions to their respective details. to navigate back home, there is a navbar above to indicate where the user is at.
